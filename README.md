### Hi there, I'm [Nanevie Elisée AMEGASSI](https://0eix.github.io)! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I am a passionate Computer Scientist and aspiring Computational Cognitive Science Researcher with a deep interest in Cognitive Modeling, Brain-Inspired AI, and Educational Neuroscience. Currently, I am diving into the fascinating world of Cognitive Science as a master's student at [Grenoble Institute of Technology (Grenoble INP - Phelma, UGA)](https://phelma.grenoble-inp.fr/).

With an M.Sc. in Computer Science from [Cheikh Anta Diop University](https://www.ucad.sn/) and a B.Sc. in Computer Science applied to Management from [Groupe ISM](https://www.groupeism.sn/), my academic journey has been quite an adventure. Beyond the classroom, I've been fortunate to gain hands-on experience as a software engineer and consultant, delivering innovative software solutions to clients in Togo and Senegal.

🔭 **Research Interests**:
- **Cognitive Modeling**: Unveiling the intricacies of the human mind through computational models.
- **Brain-Inspired AI**: Drawing inspiration from nature to advance artificial intelligence.
- **Educational Neuroscience**: Enhancing learning experiences through the lens of neuroscience.

🌍 **Open to Relocation**:
- I am eager to relocate for career opportunities and look forward to collaborating with exceptional research communities around the globe.
